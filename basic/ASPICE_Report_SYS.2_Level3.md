Practices that cannot be checked due to missing documentation:
- **SYS.2.BP5 (Traceability part)**: The stakeholder requirements document was not provided, so bidirectional traceability cannot be verified.
- **SYS.2.BP6**: The act of communication (e.g., meeting minutes, email records) cannot be directly verified. The assessment relies on inferring communication from the state of the work product.
- **All Generic Practices for PA 2.1, PA 3.1, PA 3.2**: These practices require evidence from documents such as a Project Management Plan, Organizational Process Definitions, Tailoring Guidelines, Measurement Reports, and Training Records. None of these documents were provided.

**Target Capability Level**: 3

### Base Practices (BPs) for SYS.2

**BP.1: Specify system requirements.**
- **Score**: L
- **Reasoning**: The document `EXAMPLE_SYS2_REQ.pdf` provides a comprehensive list of system requirements, including functional (TURBO-SYS-3), performance (TURBO-SYS-6), safety (TURBO-SYS-93), and diagnostic (TURBO-SYS-62) types. Most requirements include specific verification criteria, addressing the need for verifiability. For example, `TURBO-SYS-6` states, "The system shall achieve a target boost pressure of 1.2 bar (gauge) at 3000 RPM engine speed and 80% load," with a clear, measurable verification criterion. However, the practice is not fully achieved due to several requirements being ambiguous or untestable.
- **Gap Analysis**: Several requirements lack the necessary characteristics of being unambiguous and testable. 
  - **TURBO-SYS-8**: The requirement "The turbocharger transient response shall be fast" is subjective. The verification criterion "The performance should feel responsive to the driver" is not measurable.
  - **TURBO-SYS-14**: The requirement for temperature to "remain within an acceptable range" is not specific. The verification criterion "The temperature is checked and is okay" is untestable.
  - **TURBO-SYS-80**: The requirement "The system shall survive thermal shock testing" is vague without referencing a specific standard or profile. The verification criterion "The component passes the test" is insufficient.
- **Suggestions**: 
  - For **TURBO-SYS-8**, replace the subjective requirement with a quantifiable one, such as the one in **TURBO-SYS-9**: "The system shall reach 90% of target boost pressure within 350ms..."
  - For **TURBO-SYS-14**, define the specific temperature range (e.g., "shall not exceed 150°C") and the conditions under which it applies.
  - For **TURBO-SYS-80**, reference a specific industry standard for thermal shock testing (e.g., ISO 16750-4) that defines the temperature profiles, cycles, and pass/fail criteria.

**BP.2: Structure system requirements.**
- **Score**: F
- **Reasoning**: The requirements in `EXAMPLE_SYS2_REQ.pdf` are systematically structured. They are grouped by functionality using headers (e.g., `1.0 General System Requirements`, `2.0 Performance Requirements`, `6.0 Diagnostics and Fault Handling`). Furthermore, requirements are structured for different product variants using the `Variant` attribute (e.g., `Variant: Gasoline_1.5L`, `Variant: Diesel_2.0L`, `Variant: All`). This demonstrates a clear and effective structuring approach.
- **Gap Analysis**: None.
- **Suggestions**: None.

**BP.3: Analyze system requirements.**
- **Score**: L
- **Reasoning**: There is clear evidence that an analysis of the requirements for correctness and technical feasibility has been performed. This is visible through the explicit `(Issue: ...)` comments within the document itself. For example: 
  - `TURBO-SYS-8: (Issue: Vague/Untestable)`
  - `TURBO-SYS-18: (Issue: Likely incorrect ASIL, control accuracy is safety-relevant)`
  - `TURBO-SYS-44: (Issue: Mismatched verification criteria)`
The use of a `Status` field (`draft`, `in review`, `approved`, `rejected`) also indicates a formal analysis and review process. The practice is not fully achieved because some requirements with identified issues have been set to 'approved' (e.g., `TURBO-SYS-9` where the verification method is noted as incorrect), indicating a weakness in ensuring issues are resolved before approval.
- **Gap Analysis**: The process for resolving issues found during analysis is not consistently enforced. Some requirements are approved despite containing identified and unresolved flaws. For example, **TURBO-SYS-9** is 'approved' but the document notes `(Issue: Incorrect method, should be Test)`.
- **Suggestions**: Implement a stricter rule in the review process that prevents a requirement from being moved to the 'approved' state if it has open, unresolved issues. Ensure that all identified issues are either corrected or formally accepted with a documented rationale.

**BP.4: Analyze the impact on the system context.**
- **Score**: F
- **Reasoning**: The requirements demonstrate a thorough analysis of the impact on the operating environment and system context. This is evidenced by requirements that define interactions with other system elements. For example:
  - `TURBO-SYS-17`: Defines the interaction with the "Engine Control Unit (ECU)".
  - `TURBO-SYS-95`: Defines the impact on the engine by stating the goal is to "prevent engine damage".
  - `TURBO-SYS-79`: Defines the impact of the vehicle's operating environment by requiring the system to "withstand mechanical vibrations as specified in document [VIB-PROFILE-001]".
- **Gap Analysis**: None.
- **Suggestions**: None.

**BP.5: Ensure consistency and bidirectional traceability.**
- **Score**: N
- **Reasoning**: This practice has two main components: consistency and traceability. 
  - **Traceability**: There is no evidence of bidirectional traceability to stakeholder requirements, as no stakeholder requirement specification was provided. This is a major gap.
  - **Consistency**: There are demonstrable inconsistencies within the work product. For example, `TURBO-SYS-44` has a requirement for "turbine speed sensor accuracy" but the verification criteria describes testing a temperature sensor: "The sensor shall report a temperature of 25°C +/- 2°C...".
- **Gap Analysis**: 
  1. Complete lack of traceability links to stakeholder requirements.
  2. Presence of internal inconsistencies between requirements and their verification criteria (e.g., **TURBO-SYS-44**).
- **Suggestions**: 
  1. Implement a requirements management tool or system to establish and maintain explicit traceability links between each system requirement and its parent stakeholder requirement(s).
  2. Perform a consistency check on all requirements to ensure the requirement text, verification criteria, and verification method are aligned. Correct inconsistencies like the one in **TURBO-SYS-44**.

**BP.6: Communicate agreed system requirements and impact on the system context.**
- **Score**: -
- **Reasoning**: This practice cannot be fully assessed as direct evidence of communication (e.g., meeting minutes, review invitations) is not available. However, the work product `EXAMPLE_SYS2_REQ.pdf` itself serves as a formal communication artifact. The use of attributes like `Status: approved` and `Current version: X` strongly implies that a process for agreement and communication exists.
- **Gap Analysis**: Lack of direct evidence of communication activities.
- **Suggestions**: Maintain records of requirement review meetings, including attendee lists and decisions, to provide explicit evidence of communication and agreement with affected parties.

### Generic Practices (GPs) for Level 3

**PA 2.1: Process performance management process attribute**
- **Score**: N
- **Reasoning**: No evidence was provided to demonstrate the management of the process performance. Documents such as a project plan, schedule, resource plan, or progress monitoring reports are required to satisfy the generic practices of this attribute (GP 2.1.1 - GP 2.1.6).
- **Gap Analysis**: Complete lack of documented evidence for planning, resource management, and monitoring of the SYS.2 process.
- **Suggestions**: Create a project plan that defines the objectives, strategy, schedule, and resource needs for the system engineering activities, including requirements analysis. Regularly monitor progress against this plan and document any adjustments.

**PA 2.2: Work product management process attribute**
- **Score**: P
- **Reasoning**: There is evidence for the *execution* of work product management, but not for the *definition* of the requirements for it. 
  - **GP 2.2.3 (Identify, store, control)** is demonstrated by the use of unique IDs (`TURBO-SYS-X`) and version numbers (`Current version: X`) for every item.
  - **GP 2.2.4 (Review and adjust)** is demonstrated by the `Status` field (`draft`, `in review`, `approved`, `rejected`) and `Modified Date`, which show a review lifecycle. 
However, there is no evidence for **GP 2.2.1** and **GP 2.2.2**, which require the *definition* of requirements for work products (e.g., in a QA Plan) and their storage/control (e.g., in a Configuration Management Plan).
- **Gap Analysis**: No documentation (like a Configuration Management Plan or Quality Assurance Plan) was provided that defines the requirements for the work products, including content, structure, review criteria, storage, and versioning strategy.
- **Suggestions**: Create a Configuration Management Plan that defines the identification, versioning, change control, and baselining strategy for all work products, including requirements. Create a Quality Assurance Plan that defines the quality criteria and review/approval procedures for work products.

**PA 3.1: Process definition process attribute**
- **Score**: N
- **Reasoning**: To achieve Level 3, a standard process for SYS.2 must be defined at the organizational level (GP 3.1.1) and there must be guidance for tailoring it (GP 3.1.2). No organizational process assets or tailoring guidelines were provided.
- **Gap Analysis**: Lack of a defined standard process for System Requirements Analysis and associated tailoring guidelines.
- **Suggestions**: Document a standard process for System Requirements Analysis that describes the required activities, roles, responsibilities, and work products. This process should be stored in an organizational process library. Create tailoring guidelines that instruct projects on how to adapt the standard process based on project size, complexity, and risk.

**PA 3.2: Process deployment process attribute**
- **Score**: N
- **Reasoning**: There is no evidence that a standard process has been deployed, that process and work product measures have been collected and analyzed, or that personnel have been trained on the process (GP 3.2.1 - GP 3.2.4). This requires evidence such as a project's tailored process definition, measurement data, analysis reports, and training records.
- **Gap Analysis**: No evidence of deploying a standard process, collecting data from its deployment, or ensuring staff are competent in its execution.
- **Suggestions**: For the project, create a 'Defined Process' document that shows how the organizational standard process for SYS.2 was tailored. Establish a measurement plan to collect data related to the process (e.g., number of requirement issues found in review, time to approve requirements). Analyze this data to understand process performance and identify improvement opportunities. Maintain training records for engineers involved in the process.

### Final Summary & Recommendations

The SYS.2 process shows a strong foundation at Level 1, with systematic creation and structuring of requirements. However, significant gaps prevent the process from achieving a higher capability level. The lack of traceability (BP.5) and unresolved inconsistencies (BP.3, BP.5) are critical weaknesses at the base practice level. Furthermore, a complete lack of evidence for any of the Generic Practices for PA 2.1, PA 3.1, and PA 3.2 means that Capability Level 2 and 3 cannot be achieved. The project must focus on establishing traceability, ensuring requirement quality, and documenting the management and organizational processes that support the engineering work.
